No dependencies React component for animating height using CSS transitions.
Slide an element up and down or animate it to any specific height.
Content's opacity can be optionally animated as well (check `animateOpacity` prop bellow).

CSS classes are applied in specific animation states, check `animationStateClasses` prop.

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

### Version 3

This is version 3.x branch, rewritten to hooks, which means you'll need React version 16.8 or newer.

For version 2.x, check [v2 branch](https://github.com/Stanko/react-animate-height/tree/v2)

#### Breaking changes:

- Callback names changed (to avoid clashing with the native ones):
  - `onAnimationStart` -> `onHeightAnimationStart`
  - `onAnimationEnd` -> `onHeightAnimationEnd`

## Demo

Live demo: [muffinman.io/react-animate-height](https://muffinman.io/react-animate-height/)

Because multiple people asked how to animate list items, I created this [simple example](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-animated-list-example-made-using-react-animate-height-je9q1) for that as well.

To build the examples locally, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser of choice browser.

Or play with this [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-animate-height-v3-basic-example-ix6c5v).

## Quick start

Get it from npm

```
$ npm install --save react-animate-height
```

Import and use it in your React app.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import AnimateHeight from 'react-animate-height';

const Example = () => {
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        aria-expanded={height !== 0}
        aria-controls="example-panel"
        onClick={() => setHeight(height === 0 ? 'auto' : 0)}
      >
        {height === 0 ? 'Open' : 'Close'}
      </button>

      <AnimateHeight
        id="example-panel"
        duration={500}
        height={height} // see props documentation below
      >
        <h1>Your content goes here</h1>
        <p>Put as many React or HTML components here.</p>
      </AnimateHeight>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Props

- **height**: numeric or percentage value (ie. `'50%'`) or `'auto'`, required

  When changed, element height will be animated to that height.<br/>
  To slide up use <code>0</code>, for slide down use <code>'auto'</code>

- **duration**: integer, default: `500`

  Duration of the animation in milliseconds

- **delay**: integer, default: `0`

  Animation delay in milliseconds

- **easing**: string, default: `'ease'`

  CSS easing function to be applied to the animation

- **id**: string

  HTML `id` attribute.

- **className**: string

  CSS class to be applied to the element

  **Please note that you shouldn't apply properties that are messing with the layout (like `display`, `height`...), as these might break height calculations**

- **style**: object

  CSS style object, it will be merged with inline styles of the component

  **Please note that you shouldn't apply properties that are messing with the layout (`display`, `height` are omitted from the type already), as these might break height calculations**

- **contentClassName**: string

  CSS class to be applied to content wrapper element

  **Please note that you shouldn't apply properties that are messing with the layout (like `display`, `height`...), as these might break height calculations**

- **animationStateClasses**: object

  Object containing CSS class names for animation states, default:

  ```
  {
    animating:                  'rah-animating',
    animatingUp:                'rah-animating--up',
    animatingDown:              'rah-animating--down',
    static:                     'rah-static',
    animatingToHeightZero:      'rah-animating--to-height-zero',
    animatingToHeightAuto:      'rah-animating--to-height-auto',
    animatingToHeightSpecific:  'rah-animating--to-height-specific',
    staticHeightZero:           'rah-static--height-zero',
    staticHeightAuto:           'rah-static--height-auto',
    staticHeightSpecific:       'rah-static--height-specific',
  }
  ```

  Please note that this one will be merged with the default object and cached when component is created,
  so changing it afterwards will have no effect.

- **onHeightAnimationStart**: function

  Callback which will be called when animation starts.

  This first argument passed to this callback is an object containing `newHeight`, the pixel value of the height at which the animation will end.

- **onHeightAnimationEnd**: function

  Callback which will be called when animation ends.

  This first argument passed to this callback is an object containing `newHeight`, the pixel value of the height at which the animation ended.

- **applyInlineTransitions**: boolean, default: `true`

  If this flag is set to `false` only CSS classes will be applied to the element and inline
  transition styles will not be present.

- **animateOpacity**: boolean, default: `false`

  If set to `true` content will fade-in (and fade-out) while height is animated.

- **aria-hidden**: boolean

  By default, library will set `aria-hidden` to `true` when height is zero. If you wish to override it, you can pass the prop yourself.

Additional props will be passed to the wrapper div, to make adding attrs like `aria-*` easier.

## Accessibility

Library will hide the content using `display: hidden` when height props is 0. It will also apply `aria-hidden="true"` in the same case, but you can override it by passing `aria-hidden` prop yourself.

When using a button to toggle height, make sure you add `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` to make everything accessible. Here's an example:

```jsx
<button
  aria-expanded={ height !== 0 }
  aria-controls="example-panel" // it has to match the id passed to AnimateHeight
  onClick={ toggleHeight } // your click handler that toggles height
  // ... all other props
>
  Toggle
</button>

<AnimateHeight id="example-panel">
  Content
</AnimateHeight>
```

### Reduced motion

Component checks for `prefers-reduced-motion` on start and disables animations if it is set to true. Please note that component doesn't listen for potential changes of `prefers-reduced-motion` option.

## Gotchas

### Collapsing margins

While it is animating, component has `overflow: hidden`. When the animation is finished and height is set to "auto", `overflow: hidden` is removed. At that moment, any margins you have on the content inside `AnimateHeight` will collapse, causing content to "jump". To avoid this, just use padding inside the `AnimateHeight` instead of margins.

### Bounded flexboxes

If `AnimateHeight` is a flex child and it's parent has a fixed height, animation won't work.
To fix this, you just need to add the following CSS rule to the `AnimateHeight` instance.

```css
flex-shrink: 0;
```

You can do it by passing a `className` or directly in the `style` prop

```jsx
<AnimateHeight style={{flexShrink: 0}}>
```
